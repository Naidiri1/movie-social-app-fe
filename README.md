# Iriscope - Full-Stack Social Movie Platform 🎬

**[Live Demo](https://movie-social-app-fe-57kb.vercel.app/login)** | **[Frontend GitHub](https://github.com/Naidiri1/movie-social-app-fe)** | **[Backend GitHub](https://github.com/Naidiri1/movie-social-app-be)** | **[Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/duTqdjZNbug)**

## 🌟 Project Overview  

Most streaming platforms only let you consume content — they don’t help you **organize, reflect, and share** your movie journey.  
Iriscope is a full-stack web application that combines **social networking** with a **personal movie library**, allowing users to:  
- Track watched, favorite, and “watch later” movies  
- Rank their Top 10 with a custom drag-and-drop system  
- Write and share reviews securely with the community
- Populate their libraries based on popular and upcoming films
- Search users'profiles and like/dislike comments motivating user to engage to the community

Built with **React + TypeScript + Redux (frontend)** and **Spring Boot + PostgreSQL (backend)**, Iriscope demonstrates production-ready engineering patterns, authentication, performance optimization, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights  

### Frontend  
- **React (Hooks + TS)** – dynamic UI with type safety  
- **Redux Toolkit** – state across multiple complex views  
- **Material Tailwind** – responsive, accessible styling  
- **Optimistic UI updates** – smooth UX without reloads  

### Backend  
- **Spring Boot (Java 17)** – modular service layer architecture  
- **PostgreSQL** – relational DB with indexes for fast search  
- **DTO + Repository pattern** – separation of concerns, maintainability  
- **REST API design** – consistent, versioned endpoints  
- **TMDb API integration** – external data ingestion  

### DevOps & Deployment  
- **Frontend:** Vercel (Next.js build)  
- **Backend & DB:** Railway (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)  
- **Environment configs:** `.env` setup with API keys and secrets

## ⚡ Engineering Challenges & Lessons Learned  

- **Scalability:** Implemented server-side pagination to handle >1,000 movies with stable performance.  
- **Security:** Designed JWT flow with refresh tokens, preventing session hijacking.  
- **Data Modeling:** Normalized DB schema for Favorites, Watched, and Top 10 without duplication.  
- **Algorithms:** Built custom drag-and-drop ranking system leveraging arrays and React state reconciliation.  
- **Team Practices:** Used GitHub Projects for task tracking, pull requests for code reviews, and issue templates for bug triage.
- **Deployment Debugging:** Faced repeated failed builds (~100 redeploys on Vercel) due to Material Tailwind incompatibility with Next.js 14. Resolved by downgrading to a stable release, documenting the fix, and validating successful production deployment.
